### Summary
Scissor.io is a spoof of the "popular" online multiplayer game [slither.io](slither.io). Scissor.io will not feature multiplayer functionality at first, however it is part of the extension goals. Players will control a pair of scissors with the simple goal of surviving in a dangerous world. You will be centered in the middle of the screen, and the world will move around you. You will continue forward at a constant speed, their only inputs being to turn and to perform a lunge attack in the direction they are facing. **This is a family friendly game- there is no blood when being stabbed.**
